				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Cyberbullying?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Online bullying, or cyberbullying, occurs frequently to teens using the Internet, cell phones or other devices. These teens often experience texts or images intended to hurt or embarrass them. Almost half of all American teens are victims of cyber bullying. Whether you’ve been a victim of cyberbullying or know someone who has been cyberbullied, there are steps you and your friends can take to stop cyberbullying and stay cyber-safe.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How are people cyberbullied?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Cyberbullying occurs when an individual uses the Internet or another form of technology to harm other people, in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner. In some cases a person may pretend that they are another person online to trick others. They could spread lies and rumors about victims, trick people into revealing personal information, send or forward mean text messages, and post pictures of victims without their consent.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is bullying the same as cyberbullying? What makes them different?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>While bullying occurs as a face-to-face confrontation, cyberbullying occurs online and involves the use of technologies. Cyberbullying can be even more vicious than bullying since cyberbullying can occur repeatedly in front of a massive online audience, with the cyberbully’s identity unknown, while the victim feels helpless because the attacks can come from several different online sources day in and day out.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do people cyberbully others?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>People who cyberbully others are often driven by feelings of anger, revenge, and frustration. In many cases, cyberbullies were once victims of bullying who weren’t guided in the proper direction. However, the power-hungry are the most nefarious; they cyberbully with the pure intent of tormenting others or bolstering their ego. Luckily, most cyberbullies do not fall into that category. In a recent poll, 81% of cyberbullies have stated that they cyberbully others because they think it’s “funny”. Many others don’t cyberbully others on purpose. It occurs by accident and the “cyberbully” either sends a message to the wrong recipient or act impulsively without realizing the consequences, thinking it’s not a big deal. Because their motives differ, the solutions and responses to each type of cyberbullying incident has to differ as well. Kids cyberbully primarily to replace the social skills that they were supposed to develop in grade school, middle school, and high school. As children go through their developmental stages, they should be finding ways of working out problems with their peers and getting along with other people, which includes learning how to read social situations, make friends, and understand their social environment. Bullies however, use aggression, violence, and verbal abuse to supplant these skills. They don’t have to learn how to work things out because they solve their problems through harassment and intimidation. Cyberbullies, in addition to using cruel methods, hide behind the anonymity of a computer or cell phone, and over time, bullying becomes a natural response to any situation where they feel socially awkward, insecure, frightened, or embarrassed.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do cyberbullying victims and perpetrators fit any stereotypical profile?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Neither victims nor perpetrators fit into any stereotypical profile. The “good kids”, the “quiet kids”, as well as “troublesome kids” can be either bullies or victims. Due to the fact that online communication allows bullies to remain anonymous, people often become more emboldened and vicious in their attacks than they would be in a face-to-face encounter. Many cyberbullies have admitted that they wouldn’t have made the same choices if their identities had been known.</p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Reactions</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do people react to cyber bullying?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There are two types of reactions. People either react positively or negatively. Positive victim reaction involves blocking communication with the cyberbully, deleting messages without reading them, talking to a friend about the bullying, or reporting the problem to an internet service provider or website monitor. Negative victim reaction involves seeking revenge on the bully, avoiding friends and activities, and even cyberbullying others.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I respond and to cyberbullying?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>In some scenarios, cyberbullying can be ignored if the case is an unthreatening act, a prank, or a mild tease. The bully may get bored waiting and moves on. Cyberbullies actually want you to respond to them so they can expose your response to their audience. Yet we strongly urge you to take preventive measures against cyberbullying, which can be done by restricting the people who can communicate with you. Restrict others from being able to freely add you to their buddy list. If someone seems aggressive or makes you uncomfortable and doesn’t respond to verbal pleas or formal warnings, he or she should be blocked. You can even warn the sender by reporting the cyberbullying case to an Internet monitor service or a website monitor. In serious cases, you can report incidents to the police if someone threatens you physically. If you feel that you or someone you know is in danger, contact the police immediately and cut off contact with this person or user. Stay offline if you cannot avoid this person.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I prevent cyberbullying and stay cyber-safe?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You can refuse to pass along cyberbullying messages. Tell friends to stop cyberbullying, block communication with cyberbullies, and report cyberbullying to a trusted adult. To stay cyber-safe, never post or share your personal information online or your friends’ personal information (this includes your full name, address, telephone number, school name, parents’ names or credit card number). Never share your Internet passwords with anyone and never meet face-to-face with someone you only met online.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">If a parent suspects their child is a cyberbully, what should they do?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The parent can start by teaching the child about social responsibility. Have the child imagine the situation in reverse. Cyberbullying can spiral to a massive level, even though cyberbullies may have just sent a post or text that initially started off as a joke. It is also important to teach this same lesson to cyberbullying victims, because many victims in turn can become cyberbullies themselves.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I report a cyber bullying incident?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, “Law enforcement agencies have different policies, but your local police department or FBI branch are good starting points” for reporting cyberbullying. Some areas have implemented anti-bullying laws. If you believe the cyber bullying is school related, find out whether your school subscribes to SchoolTipline or another system that allows anonymous reports of cyber bullying. Present your evidence to officials. Be as specific as possible about the cyber bullying and the victim’s reaction to it. Some victims experience only embarrassment, while others experience fear, depression, anger and worry about physical safety. People who are cyber bullied may lose sleep, become ill, withdraw from social activities or miss days of school or work. Tell officials the outcome you want. You may believe the cyber bully deserves a reprimand, the loss of online privileges, expulsion from school or arrest. The reporting authorities you consult should explain to you why that outcome will or will not happen. If officials downplay or ignore the harassment, calmly explain that you will consult a different authority. If a principal or school superintendent fails to act, a local police department may be able to offer help.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I take control of a situation where I, or a loved one, am being cyberbullied?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>When you report a cyberbully, you take control of the situation and raise awareness about this issue. You may also help others who are being harassed by the same cyberbully. There are three simple steps you can follow to take charge of your situation.
	Step 1: Don’t respond directly to the cyberbully. Bullies thrive on reactions of fear, anger, sadness or confusion. Do not reply to harassing emails, voice mails, text messages, instant messages or blog posts. Do not post comments related to upsetting photographs.
	Step 2: Preserve and gather your evidence. Print out hard copies of emails, blog posts, instant messages and online images. Save copies of voice mails. Note dates and times of transmission. As much as you might want to wipe your hard drive clean, archive electronic copies of the harassing messages instead.
	Step 3: Determine the scope of the problem. Notice whether the cyberbully is using only one form of technology or multiple forms of attack. Try to determine whether the attacks are a one-on-one problem or whether they involve multiple cyber bullies or victims. If your child is the victim, gently ask questions to determine whether he has told you everything about the harassment.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How should victims respond to cyber bullying?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Cyber bullying victims should never have to feel alone in their situation. If you are being targeted online, it is important to discuss any incidents that make you feel uncomfortable with a trusted adult, such as a family member, teacher, or school counselor. Block the e-mail addresses and cell phone numbers of people who are sending you unwanted messages. If the messages continue, an adult family member can help you change your phone numbers, e-mail addresses or screen names. A parent may also wish to file complaints with e-mail services, Internet Service Providers, Web sites, cell phone companies, etc. Service providers can often find the offenders, cancel their service, and report them to the police if deemed necessary. When in doubt about what to do, log off the computer, turn of the cell phone, and ask for help from a trusted adult. Never ignore bullying; bullies use provocation to elicit a response from their target and if ignored, the harassment will only get worse.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can one prevent cyber bullying and stay cyber-safe?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There are certain preventative measures you must take to create a safer haven on the Internet for teenagers and adults alike. You should refuse to pass along any messages that may denigrate a person or a group of people, block communication with cyber bullies, and report incident of cyber bullying to a trusted adult. To stay cyber-safe, never post or share your personal information online. This includes your full name, address, telephone number, school name, parents’ names or credit card number. Furthermore, never disclose information when you are not in the position to do so. Do not share your Internet passwords with anyone, and never meet face-to-face with someone you only met online. Make sure your passwords are secure and that your information on social networking sites is private. Remember the manner in which you conduct yourself online is a reflection of who you are. Be keenly aware of the dangers of the Internet with each move you take.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why Educators Need To Learn Prevention</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Educators must also learn how to protect themselves and others from cyberbullying. With the rise of many social networking sites and the increased usage of the Internet by both students and teachers, many school employees may become victim to cyberbullying.
	Cyberbullying can have a serious impact on the health, well-being, and self-confidence of those targeted. It may have a significant impact not only on the person being bullied, but on their home and work life too. Teachers and other educators who become victims of cyberbullying may have their career progression affected, and there have been cases where the person bullied has chosen to leave the education sector altogether. Dealing with incidents quickly and effectively is key to minimizing the harm of potentially stressful situations.

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Protecting staff from cyberbullying is best done within a prevention framework, with whole school policies and practices designed to combat cyberbullying. Each school should have a designated cyberbullying lead, a member of the senior management team tasked with overseeing and managing the recording, investigation and resolution of all bullying incidents.</p>
